    <h1>Test Front-end</h1>
    <p>In this exercise, you will have to build a component exactly like this
      one.</p>
  </app-box>
  <app-box class="component">
    <form [formGroup]="form" novalidate>
      <img class="fake-component" src="assets/fake-component.png">
      <!--<app-selector></app-selector>-->
    </form>

    <h3>TODO</h3>
    <img src="assets/component-interface.png" alt="Component interface">
    <ol>
      <li>Design the component using CSS and HTML.</li>
      <li>Make it work with the Array&lt;Day&gt; generated in the AppComponent
        (days)
      </li>
      <li>Add pagination to the component and the buttons to control it. Look at
        the shadows that appears in both sides if there are more pagination.
      </li>
      <li>Make it responsive. If the browser is resized or the parent container
        decreases, the component should adapt to its parent. To simply the
        problem, if the component isn't in the first page while is being
        resized, you will reset the pagination in that event.
      </li>
      <li>Add an input attribute [multiple]="boolean" to the component. If
        multiple true, the component will allow selecting more than one date, in
        other case, only once.
      </li>
      <li>Make it compatible with NgModel.
        &lt;app-selector [(ngModel)]="model"&gt;&lt;/app-selector>
      </li>
      <li>
        Do test cases you consider necessary in order to check the component
        works properly.
      </li>
      <li>Run <b>npm run lint</b> and fix lint issues.</li>
      <li>Generate a git patch with all changes and send it to
        sergio@tulotero.es.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If you have problems to figure the exercise out, you can send the patch even
      if you aren't able to finish any of the latest points.
    </p>

    Good luck! :-)
